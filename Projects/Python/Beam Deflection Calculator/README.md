# Introduction
Beam Deflection Calculator is a simple program designed to calculate and plot the deflection of a beam using Eulerâ€“Bernoulli beam theory. Structural/mechanical engineers or students might find this useful. 

# Features
The program can currently calculate and plot the deflection of a single fixed end beam with a single point load.

# Future Work
Other beam support and loading configurations shall be considered for future work.
