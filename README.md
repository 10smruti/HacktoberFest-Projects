I'll try to merge your pull request as quickly as possible!

### Quality
We want this repo to count in HacktoberFest, so we need to abide by their core rules, one of which includes quality.
Here is an example of what you should not make because it does not have sufficiant quality:
```
A number guessing game in python
```
I mean come on, that's just a few if/else statements and a while loop.

However, the following adds complexity to it, and in-turn improves quality.
```
A program that shows the best stratergy for number guesssing games
```
This would require you to think about different stratergies you can take when playing a guessing game, and then code them in and see which one is the best. 

**Many people have different opinions on what is sufficiant quality. Please be sure to make an issue and have it assigned to you before you start. We would hate it if your work was for nothing, but at the same time, we also need to make sure that this repo counts for other people**

Remember, you should not be contributing to this repo to just +1 your PR count. This is why when you make an issue, we require you to provide a use case.
